### Hi there 👋

- 🦷 From filling cavities to filling code repositories - I've made quite the career pivot!
- 🚀 Software developer since 2017, specializing in mobile applications and backend development
- 🎯 Currently diving deep into system programming with [C][c_link] - because why not challenge myself?
- 🌟 [Flutter][flutter_link] enthusiast and [Dart][dart_link] aficionado - ask me anything about cross-platform magic!
- 🌱 Always learning, always growing - from [Android][android_link] to [Spring Boot][spring_boot_link], I've worn many hats
- 📚 In tech, if you're not learning, you're compile-aining!
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on interesting open-source projects
- 💬 Find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin_link] or [Discord][discord_link] - I'm always up for a good coding discussion
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can explain both root canals and root directories with equal enthusiasm!
